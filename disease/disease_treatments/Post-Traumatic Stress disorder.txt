The most effective treatment for PTSD combines medication and trauma-focused therapy.

Some medications can help your body produce more substances that manage stress and emotions. They fall into two broad categories:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (also called SSRIs).
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (also called SNRIs).
Trauma-focused therapy examines the event and its meaning. It can be done a few different ways:

Cognitive processing therapy: This method identifies negative thoughts and beliefs about the traumatic event and tries to change them.
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): You focus on specific sounds or movements introduced by the therapist while you think about the event. It aims to make the event less upsetting over time.
Prolonged exposure therapy: This method encourages you to face thoughts, feelings and situations you’ve been avoiding. You may talk about your trauma over and over. You may also work toward doing things you’ve been staying away from.
