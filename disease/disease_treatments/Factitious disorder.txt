The first goal of treatment is to change the personâ€™s behavior and reduce their misuse of medical resources. In the case of factitious disorder imposed on another, the main goal is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims.

Once the first goal is met, treatment aims to resolve any underlying psychological issues that may be causing the behavior.

The primary treatment for factitious disorder is psychotherapy (a type of counseling). Treatment likely will focus on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Family therapy also may help in teaching family members not to reward or reinforce the behavior of the person with the disorder.

There are no medications to actually treat factitious disorder. Medication may be used, however, to treat any related disorder, such as depression or anxiety.
