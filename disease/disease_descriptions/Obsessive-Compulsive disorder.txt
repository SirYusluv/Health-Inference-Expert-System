Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition in which you have frequent unwanted thoughts and sensations (obsessions) that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors can significantly interfere with social interactions and performing daily tasks.

OCD is usually a life-long (chronic) condition, but symptoms can come and go over time.

Everyone experiences obsessions and compulsions at some point. For example, it’s common to occasionally double-check the stove or the locks. People also often use the phrases “obsessing” and “obsessed” very casually in everyday conversations. But OCD is more extreme. It can take up hours of a person’s day. It gets in the way of normal life and activities. Obsessions in OCD are unwanted, and people with OCD don’t enjoy performing compulsive behaviors.
