Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism, is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions.

These conditions are characterized by differences in communication and social interaction. People with ASD often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior.

ASD is found in people around the world, regardless of race and ethnicity, culture, or economic background.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls. A study of 8-year-olds in 11 locations throughout the United States found a 4.3-to-1, boy-to-girl ratioTrusted Source in 2016. About 1 in 54 of the study participants had ASD.

There are indications that instances of autism are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to environmental factors. However, experts debate whether thereâ€™s an actual increase in cases or just more frequent diagnoses. Compare autism rates in different U.S. states.
