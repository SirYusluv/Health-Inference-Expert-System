Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the way a person thinks, processes emotions, and responds to the environment.

ADHD is sometimes diagnosed during childhood, typically in school settings where symptoms of the condition, such as problems with behavioral control, anger issues, distractibility, and inattention, are most evident.

Several treatment options can manage symptoms successfully.

Treatments range from behavioral intervention to prescription medication. In many cases, medication alone is an effective treatment for ADHD.

However, the National Institute of Mental Health suggests that including other psychotherapeutic interventions are important.

Read on to learn about the options available today for treating ADHD.

What is ADHD?
ADHD is a mental health condition that can cause unusual levels of hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. Both adults and children can have ADHD. People with ADHD may have a hard time focusing on a single task or sitting still for a long period of time.

It can also disrupt executive functioning ability, which helps people evaluate and execute more complex situations.

There is a wide range of behaviors associated with ADHD. Some of the most common symptoms are:

having trouble focusing or concentrating on tasks
being forgetful about certain tasks
being easily distracted
talking excessively
interrupting others when they’re carrying out a task
making frequent mistakes or missing details while they’re studying or working
losing items frequently
having trouble organizing daily tasks
