Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health issue that can develop after a distressing event. The event may be dangerous, life-threatening, shocking or very scary. Examples include:

Accident.
Fire.
Military combat.
Natural disaster, such as a tornado.
Physical abuse.
Sexual assault or rape.
Sudden death of a loved one.
Terrorist attack.
The traumatic event may have happened to you, or you may have seen it happen to someone else.

Itâ€™s normal to feel upset after something like that happening. You may have trouble sleeping, eating or doing things you enjoy for a little while. But with PTSD, symptoms last longer than a few months and interfere with your life.
